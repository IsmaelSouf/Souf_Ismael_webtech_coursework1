    <h1> Coursework Overview</h1> 
	    <p>
The aim of this coursework is to design and implement a website that enables your user to encode simple text messages using at least two different classical cyphers or encoding schemes. On your page (index.html) you must provide at least:
        </p>
         <p> 
             1. an area in which your user can type in a message<br>
             2. an area where the encoded message can be displayed<br>
             3. a way to select between different cyphers (for example a dropdown)<br>
             4. some method to cause the cypher to be computed (such as a button) and<br>
             5. some mechanism for deciphering your messages to recover the plaintext<br>
          </p>
          <p>A simple place to start is with the Caesar Cipher. The Rot13 cipher, which we investigated in the labs, is a special case of the Caesar Cipher which was used in Ancient Rome to encipher secret messages. You should research, select, and implement at least two different ciphers for your site.
There are many ways that you can extend these core requirements. For example, you may include additional cyphers and web pages, that document your site, your chosen cyphers, and the use of your pages. It is worth being creative in your extensions, for example, if you implement a Morse encoder then you might consider the use of the WebAudio API as a way to provide audio output of the Morse message.
Your page must be implemented using HTML, CSS, & Javascript and make no use of any additional libraries, templates or frameworks.
